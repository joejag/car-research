City-cars

Perfect for parking and urban transport, city cars are small, efficient and – mostly – cheap

SMALL IS GOOD
The point of a real city car is that it’s small enough. Anything bloated defeats the object
TRIM TREBLE
If you pay £7.5k for a city car, don’t expect leathery luxury. This is rational transport
CLEVER, CLEVER
The cheapest city cars are boxes; the more expensive ones, lessons in industrial design
EFFICIENCY
Some of the cheapest cars on the road to run, tax and insure, city cars make sense
TINY POWER
Some of the best city cars run three-cylinder engines. They don’t need anything bigger
GEEK CHIC
Fit for purpose motoring means you look like you thought about it. You look clever
