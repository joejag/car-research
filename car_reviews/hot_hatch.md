Hot Hatch

Practical, useful and yet still fun to drive, the archetypal hot hatchback is probably the biggest all-rounder in motoring

THE SHAPE
Hot hatches are practical. And a bit boxy. Slinky coupe versions are not as day-to-day usable
THE ENGINE
Typically, the hot hatch has a fizzy, small-ish petrol engine – but diesel is now accepted
THE SIMPLICITY
Traditionally, these cars are front-wheel drive. AWD is available in some but is expensive
THE CASH
Anything over £25k is pushing it for a hot hatch. They should be relatively cheap
THE LOOKS
A hot hatch should be handsome but not tacky. And it should be able to fit in anywhere…
RUNNING COSTS
As most are based on ‘cooking’ models, hot hatches should be cheaper to run than bigger cars

£10-28k
