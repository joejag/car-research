Estates

Some of the best-looking versions of popular cars are estates. And they have practicality to burn

VOLUME
Check the shape of the boot if you want to carry something specific – litreage is only a rough guide
DRIVING
Modern estates don’t drive much differently to saloons unless fully loaded
ENGINES
If you regularly carry full loads, go diesel. If it’s big loads or towing, go big diesel. It’ll help
NEED AN SUV?
Some estates offer 4x4 and a slightly raised ride. Do you really need a full-size SUV? Really?
CHECK DECK
Some load bays are completely flat – others have seat-shaped humps which restrict load
