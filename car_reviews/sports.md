Sports

A pea-sized boot and terrible mpg? As long as it looks amazing and goes fast, nobody will care

RUNNING COSTS
If running costs really are an issue, you should think very carefully. Not many are cheap
PRACTICALITY
A sports car is made for thrills, not tip-runs, so don’t expect huge practicality here
STYLE WARS
If a sports car doesn’t give you the tingle, then you should look somewhere else
DOORS X 2
A true sports car only has two doors. Everything else is just a ‘sports-something’
SPEED
If it isn’t sub six seconds to 62mph and 140+mph, then it really isn’t a proper sports car
FUEL
There are no totally credible diesel sports cars out there. High octane only please
