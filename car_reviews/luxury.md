Luxury

Isolation. Quality. Subtlety. These are things that make a great luxury car. That and a hefty price

IN THE REAR
Many true luxury cars have the best seats in the back, with massage and heat/cool functions
DRIVING
Luxe doesn’t have to mean floppy either. Aston’s Rapide is a luxury GT with pace
WEIGHT
There is no such thing as a lightweight luxury, so don’t expect efficiency from the luxurious
SLINKY RULES
But flash does not. A luxury car should be very slightly under the radar. Obvious bling = no
FAMILY FIT
Secondhand luxury cars make great family-of-four transport. Just get the rear DVD
GENTLE GIANTS
Luxe is about ride and comfort. Harshly sprung faster variants are pointless and bad
