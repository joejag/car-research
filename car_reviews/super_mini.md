Super Mini

More suited to the occasional inter-urban and motorway jaunt than a tiny city car, but still pocket-sized

SIZE MATTERS
A supermini is just that. Hatchback-shaped, but small enough to cope with town use
INTER-URBAN
Unlike a city car, a supermini should be able to cope with M-ways for medium journeys
CHEAP SEATS
No supermini is huge in the back, but running costs should always be on the low side
EFFICIENCY
New, high-spec three- and two- cylinder engines are brilliant. Don’t be afraid of them
DON'T SPEC
Resist the urge to splash too much on options; a supermini works best when cheap
FASHION
You can still be cool and drive a small car – superminis aren’t laughed at now
