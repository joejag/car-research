Hybrids/EVs

Not science fiction, science fact. Electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids are here to stay. And pretty good they are, too

RANGE ANXIETY
A recognised condition related to worry about whether an EV will make it home
RANGE EXTENDER
Small ‘generator’ engine that tops up the batteries that drive the wheels
HYBRID
A car with an engine that drives the wheels, and batteries that help in town. Think Prius
HOW FAR?
The best EVs generally manage a comfortable 60 miles on a charge. Commute distance
RELIABLE
Fewer moving parts in electric motors mean that EVs are more than reliable normal cars
SILENCE
Hybrids and EVs are very quiet. They tend to be quite relaxing as a result. Which is nice
