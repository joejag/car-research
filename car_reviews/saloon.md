Saloon

Standard three-box saloons are less common than they were, but they still make a lot of sense

BOOTED OR...?
Saloons can also come as hatchbacks, which are a touch more practical in use
DO DIESEL
Many saloons are optimised at the 2.0 litre diesel market, so they tend to be best
KIT LIST
The competitive market means you get plenty of toys for your cash. Look around for deals
PRICE HIKE
Do you really need a ‘premium’ badge to get the car you want? Can you do the job for less?
DRIVE
The best saloons are also fun to drive: don’t accept sloppy ride or boring handling
FAST LIVING
The more expensive, pacier saloons offer speed, space and relative subtlety
