Hatchback

The most practical, useful class on the car market. And there’s a huge choice to really confuse

PRACTICAL
Split-fold seats, a big boot, seating for five. A decent hatchback covers many bases
DIESEL DO
Modern, efficient diesel engines will return high 50s mpg and suit hatchbacks well
BEWARE BLING
Splashing out on options rarely pays in the long run so spec a hatch modestly and well
THINK
Before you shell out on a crossover or bigger car, will a hatch do the same for less cash?
ALL ROUNDED
A hatch should cope with M-way and city alike. And some are even fun to drive fast
FASHION
OK, so a cooking hatch isn’t the sexiest car you can buy, but modern ones are neat
