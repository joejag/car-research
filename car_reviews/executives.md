Executives

A saloon with a premium badge, generally better quality… and the associated weighty price hike

CHECK SPEC
A better badge means you pay more for less obvious toys. So be careful totting up
DRIVING
A proper executive saloon should really deliver driving pleasure. If not, ditch it
SPEED
Some of the Execs really are very fast indeed. Some of the large diesels especially so
ECO VERSIONS
BMW’s ‘Efficient Dynamics’ has made it cool to be efficient; look out for clean variants
SERVICE
If you’re shelling out, a dealer should treat you with respect. Make sure that they do
RESIDUALS
Exec saloons tend to have very good residual values. Good news when you come to trade
