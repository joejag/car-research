Small SUVs

Small SUVs cover a lot of the bases of the big’uns, but are smaller, more efficient and less obvious

FWD OPTION
Unlike the big brother SUVs, small ones often have a front-wheel-drive-only option
TOUGH STUFF
However, most small SUVs can still cope with a little light mud and off-roading
SEVEN SEATS
Do you really need a full-size SUV? Some of the little ones have a seven-seat version…
EFFICIENCY
Smaller SUVs need smaller engines; they cost about the same to run as a traditional estate
NICHETASTIC
Small SUVs are sometimes called ‘crossovers’ or ‘softroaders’. Same thing in reality
FASHION
All the advantages of the big ones, without the slightly peeved looks from Prius drivers
