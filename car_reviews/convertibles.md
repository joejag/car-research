Convertibles

Like the open air? Don’t wear a loose wig? Then a convertible or roadster just might be for you

ROADSTER
A Roadster was designed from the outset as a convertible, rather than re-designed
TARGA
A ‘targa top’ consists of list out roof panels, not the convertible action
CC ROOF
The coupe convertible (CC) has a folding metal roof, not fabric. Safer, but heavier
MOVE ALONG
Many convertibles can now raise/lower roofs while moving. It’s very hand in real life
FAT FACTOR
A convertible usually has extra stiffening over a coupe, so tends to be heavier
BOOT SPACE
Beware roofs that eat into boot space when stowed – you can lose your entire luggage allowance
